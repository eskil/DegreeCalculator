A simple degree-minutes(fractions) add/subtract calculator.

This is written for celestial navigation using tables. The features are

* support degrees in degree and minutes, with minutes as a fraction, eg. 30Â°02'3
* support time as hours-minutes-seconds, eg. 10h20m03
* add/subtract 
* division by integer for averaging observations

It was also for me to experiment with and try learning some Swift and SwiftUI.

Todo

- [x] unit tests for DegreeCore
- [x] unit tests for ModelData's functions
- [x] treat op without input as ANS

Bugs
- [ ] disallow > 3 ints for degrees when typing
- [x] if entering 600'0, it displays 0d00'0 instead of 10d00'0
